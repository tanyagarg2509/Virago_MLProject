Problem Statement:
Build a bot/chrome extension/feature for applications to auto detect hate speech/bullying against women and report it.
> There are two ways to do it:
 - Use specific filters and keywords to check for hate speech/bullying
 - Train some classifier of your own or use [LIWC (paid)/ Open source : https://github.com/Ejhfast/empath-client] to categorize text

> Ideally you should explore some literature on the topic to get an idea about how misogyny is manifested in online social media.
Instead of directly answering your questions, I am pointing you towards some literature:
 
[1] Automatic Identification and Classification of Misogynistic Language on Twitter
[2] Online Hate Speech against Women: Automatic Identification of Misogyny and Sexism on Twitter
[3] “Real men don’t hate women”: Twitter rape threats and group identity
[4] The problem of identifying misogynist language on Twitter (and other online social spaces)
 
Seems like a very good project, especially at a time when there are several such threats against women who are into stand up
comedy in India. You can start here for learning.
 
If you want to take this up as a long term research project (want to carry it for a publication), my suggestion is to focus on such
videos on Youtube (Disclaimer: The video contains profane language and hate speech) , use ideas from the literature mentioned 
above and analyze Youtube comments. 
 
The video link is one such example, you can easily find other such videos, but be very cautious about it. If such content affects your
mind, please refrain from watching/reading it.
 
On a side note, one problem that I think you might encounter here is that most of the comments might be in Hinglish/broken English.
For starters, find such videos of people from other parts of the world where English is the native language (US/UK/Some parts of Europe),
so some analysis, and then see where you can take it
